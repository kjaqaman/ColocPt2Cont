# ColocPt2Cont
Point-to-continuum colocalization analysis

ColocPt2Cont is a colocalization software (written in Matlab) that is designed to:

1. Assess colocalization between two molecular entities from multi-channel high-resolution light microscopy images when one molecule has a punctate appearance while the other has a continuous appearance.
2. Assess the above colocalization in the context of a third molecular entity (i.e. "conditional" colocalization).
